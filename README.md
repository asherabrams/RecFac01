# RecFac01
Approximates e as sum of 1/x!.

The conventional notation is 1 + (1/1!) + (1/2!) + (1/3!) ... but here it is more compact to express it as 1 + (1/1) + (1/2) + ((1/2)/3) ... etc.

In fact the initial 1 term could be included in the factorial progression since 0! is defined as 1, so 0!/1 = 1.

I'm pleased to say the program compiled, ran, and produced the expected output on the very first try.
